Current Research
The aim of Rushdi's research is to extract meaningful relations from biomedical texts. To do that, he has proposed a method to extract content-rich sentences from texts based on their reading difficulty. He hypothesized and proved that the sentences that are difficult to read contain more relations and ideas.
